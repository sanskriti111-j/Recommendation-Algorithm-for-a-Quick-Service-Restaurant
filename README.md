# Recommendation-Algorithm-for-a-Quick-Service-Restaurant
This project implements a personalized recommendation algorithm designed for Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs) to enhance customer experience and improve sales. The system leverages customer purchase history, item co-occurrence patterns, and contextual features (e.g., time of day, day of week) to recommend relevant menu items in real-time.
